## Appeals to bring Order to Chaos

To avoid chaotic situations, we compiled a list of helpful plea, with the idea to improve the experience for everybody:
- Please do not skip or select songs in the playlist (because it will affect everybody)
- Please add songs only to the end of the playlist
- Please do not spam the list.

Thanks!

# Video chat rooms

Here you find a full list of video chat rooms. If some rooms experience connection problems, please use rooms from other servers.

## Appeals to bring Order to Chaos

Again, to avoid annoyances and chaos, plase keep these helpful plea in mind:
- Please turn down your speakers or use a headset to avoid feedback
- Please avoid cross talking
